# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Space Mario, but a name other than Mario, or something like that.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A game based on Mario that allows the player to control the character and accumulate points.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#My project idea is to create a game similar to Mario. The software will take inputs from controls entered by the user to move the character. There will be opportunities to collect points like in real Mario. I want to add a new theme to the game as well with new colors, icons, etc. It will be executed using the LUA love software, but I have some ideas of how I can incorporate topics we already learned into the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#creating a theme
#choosing which colors, shapes, etc. to use in the game
#create obstacles/goals for the game
#character controls

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#For a better outcome, my game will have the features needed to add obstacles, have a theme, and allow the character to be controlled.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#In the best outcome for my project, I will have a complete new theme with details (characters, controls, background and all other items), as well as a way to add to the score/keep score. I could also add some obstacles that subtract points/lead to game over.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
# As a first step towards completing my final project, my goal is to get familiar with the language. I think the lab tracks will help with this, but I also will have to set aside some other time as well. Then I will need to use the code to work out specifics for my game, such as how to implement the colors and icons that I want. I'll need to become familiar with these topics, but I have an idea of how I can incorporate some of the concepts we learned in class from turtles, accumulator patterns, etc.
